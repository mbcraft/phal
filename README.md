PHP HTML Accessibility Library

The aim of PHAL - PHP HTML Accessibility Library is to create a library for
generating accessible well-formed HTML web pages.

This will not consider any localization issue, it is not in the scope of this
library, but there will be a class dedicated to identifying the page language.

Integration with WAI-ARIA directives will initially be limited,
because this library is born mainly for web content (simple forms).
Complex web application are a step further.
