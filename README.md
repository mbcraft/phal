PHP HTML Accessibility Library

The aim of PHAL - PHP HTML Accessibility Library is to create a library for
generating accessible well-formed HTML web pages.

This will not consider any localization issue, it is not in the scope of this
library, but there will be a class dedicated to identifying the page language.

Integration with WAI-ARIA directives will initially be limited,
because this library is born mainly for web content (simple forms).
Complex web application are a step further. I'll integrate if i'll be able to.

A 'guidelines.html' has ben extracted from w3c website, it contains the WCAG 2.0 guidelines.

I'm also inspired in design by ebook 'Pro HTML5 Accessibility' available in Google Play store.

Anyone can contribute, but please keep the unit tests up and running.

If some changes to license is needed by collaborators 
(eg. removing 'Copyright from MBCRAFT' for example) i think it's understandable and i'll agree.



Thanks.

Actually this project is just a draft.
